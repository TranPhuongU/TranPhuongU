## 👋 Hi there, I'm Phuong – a Unity Developer looking for an internship opportunity!

I'm an aspiring game developer based in Vietnam, focusing on 2D action games using Unity and C#.  
I'm currently learning more about 3D game development to expand my capabilities.  

In addition to Unity, I'm also familiar with Aseprite for creating and editing 2D sprites:
