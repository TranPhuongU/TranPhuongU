## 👋 Hi there, I'm Phuong – a Unity Developer looking for an internship opportunity!

I'm an aspiring game developer based in Vietnam, learning to create 2D action games and interactive experiences using Unity and C#.  
My current focus is on 2D development, and I'm also exploring 3D to broaden my skills and creativity.  
I enjoy turning ideas into playable experiences through code, gameplay systems, and visual design.  
In addition to Unity, I'm also familiar with Aseprite for editing and animating sprites.
